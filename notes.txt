Situation #1:
when a customer want to return a product 
=> he either contact brand, or searches for a cancel order button on website if he's logged in

a: if he contacted the brand for a return product the brand owner should minus product quantity manualy 
   from inventory
b: but if the user returned from website it should minus automaticly but the user also has to fill a form 
   and choose between the possible reasons he might want to return 
   and we have to handle if he returned a destoyed product we shouldn't take the product from him
   and the return request should be declined


Situation #2:
what if the customer contacted the shop saying the order hasn't got delivered
but we look at the order data and we find that the order marked as delivered
we then have to know the date it marked delivered and who marked it as delivered from our employees

  Possible Solution
    each time an order gets marked as delivered or pending
    => the action gets stored and the date it happened and the vendor who did it
    so each order should return a list of actions and the dates each action fired(occured)

    and we would need to create for example 4 vendor accounts with their usernames and passwords
    and give them to store owner




when creating an order:
  guest order
    - u shouldn't need token nor user id
    - it sends res w order data 
  normal order 
    - u can use token
    - then the order res comes including user id
